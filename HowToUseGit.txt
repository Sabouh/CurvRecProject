It's easy : 

First you need to clone the project : 
	you have to go on the link https://github.com/Sabouh/CurvRecProject
	then on your terminal in the spot you want your repository to be created
	(so you go "cd pathOfTheRightRepository ") 
	then you type 
	git clone theHTTPSAddressOnTheLink
	and then you have your repository with all the files needed
	
	you would have to maybe recompile the library
	
Some useful command : 

	git pull : it refresh your copy of the project so you're up to date
	
	git add name_of_file_or_repository : it adds a file/repository to the git project
	
	git commit : it save your copy of the git project
	
	git push : it sends everything you saved before by using commit on the git server
				
	git checkout name_of_file_or_repository : ignore a file/repository
	
	git status : display the list of files/repository you modified
	
	
	Basically, a main way to do things is when you begin to work on the project :
	
	git pull, to update it
	
	then you do your changes, write some code or what you want to do
	if you created new files or repositories you need to add them w/ git add
	you can type git status to see if you didn't forget to add anything
	then when you're finished working for the session you do a git commit
	and a git push.
	
	Sometimes they can be conflicts but I don't think we would have some so it's okay.
